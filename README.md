# SpendWise
The Webpage is Currently being Hosted on Vercel-
https://spend-wise-gules.vercel.app/

If you want to run the website locally,clone the repo in your system,and run npm install to install all the required node dependencies,before running npm start to start the local server.

The Task was to create the frontend of the webpage,so the graphs and charts doesn't have the functionality to change yet.

Thanks to the team of Android Club for the providing the task,hope you like my work. =)
